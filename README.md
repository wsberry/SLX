#### Current Projects Overview


#####  Source-Filter
 Source-Filter is an example of a Model-View-Controller application 
 using WinForms and C#. It was written as a testing tool
 for experimenting with copying files more efficiently with the .NET
 libraries (using buffered copying vs using the System.IO.File.Copy). 
 In the next edition of this program, a C++ shared (DLL)library will
 be used for coping the files.
