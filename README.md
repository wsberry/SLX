#### Current Projects Overview

<span style="color:#0073e6">**source-filter (C#)**</span>

 Demonstrates a Model-View-Control pattern 
 using WinForms and C#. It was written as a testing tool
 for experimenting with copying files more efficiently with the .NET
 libraries (using buffered copying vs using the System.IO.File.Copy). 
 In the next edition of this program, a C++ shared (DLL) library will
 be used for coping the files.

<span style="color:#0073e6">**cpp-file-copy (C++)**</span>

This is implemented as a DLL on Windows systems and as a shared
library on Unix compatible systems. This library is currently being used 
by the <span style="color:Black"><i>**source-filter** </i></span>project. 
The methods are declared and exported but are not implemented (i.e. the
routines merely return <span style="color:#0073e6"><i>true</i></span> at
this time).
